# Flight_Pricing_Prediction_Project
Flight Pricing Prediction Dashboard  As part of my Infosys Springboard internship, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze flight pricing data and extract insights. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations and helps predict pricing trends, showcasing my skills in Business Intelligence and data analysis.


**About Dataset**
The provided dataset contains information on various flights, including details about the airline, route, price, flight class, dates, and additional attributes related to the flight experience. The key columns in the dataset include:

Airline: The airline operating the flight.

Source: Departure city.

Destination: Arrival city.

Price: Ticket price.

Class Category: Flight class category (e.g., Economy, Business).

Class: Encoded flight class.

Day: Day of the month.

Month: Month of the year.

Flight Number: Unique flight identifier.

Route: Flight route.

Route Category: Encoded route.

From Category: Encoded departure city.

To Category: Encoded arrival city.

Date: Flight date.

Days Left: Days left until the flight.

Days Left Category: Encoded days left.

Airline Index: Encoded airline.

Route Index: Encoded route.

Duration in Minutes: Flight duration.

Stops: Number of stops.

Stops Category: Encoded number of stops.

Arrival Daytime Category: Categorical arrival time (e.g., Night Arrival, Daytime Arrival).

Departure Daytime Category: Categorical departure time (e.g., Night Departure, Daytime Departure).

Month Category: Categorical month.

Season: Season of the flight.

Seat Availability: Number of available seats.

Flight Capacity: Total number of seats on the flight.

**Problem Statement**
The goal of the flight price prediction project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a flight ticket based on various features such as the airline, route, flight class, and other relevant attributes. The prediction model aims to help airlines optimize their pricing strategies and enhance their competitive edge in the market.
